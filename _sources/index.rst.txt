Introduction
------------

VCF data is typically nested and difficult to work with. 
To facilitate analysis of VCF data, this library reads VCF files into 
Pandas or Polars DataFrames and extracts nested fields to the top level, 
with a focus on the INFO fields and sample-associated fields. 

Note: This project builds off our `previous work <https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/vcf-4-population-genomics-team-abdennur>`_ 
at the VCF Files for Population Genomics: Scaling to Millions of Samples 
codeathon co-hosted by NCBI and NIAID.
