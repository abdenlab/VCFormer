# VCFormer

VCF data is typically nested and difficult to work with. To facilitate analysis of VCF data, this library reads VCF files into Pandas or Polars DataFrames and extracts nested fields to the top level, with a focus on the INFO and sample genotype fields.

Note: This project builds off our [previous work](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/vcf-4-population-genomics-team-abdennur) at the VCF Files for Population Genomics: Scaling to Millions of Samples codeathon co-hosted by NCBI and NIAID.


## Installation
In your preferred Python (virtual) environment, run the following from the root of the cloned project: `pip install -e .`


## Contribution
Install dev dependencies:
`pip install '.[dev]'`

Install pre-commit:
`pip install pre-commit`
`pre-commit install`


## Usage
```python
import vcformer as vcf

# Read info schema as pandas dataframe
info_schema = vcf.read_info_schema("<PATH TO VCF>")

# Read sample schema as pandas dataframe
sample_schema = vcf.read_sample_schema("<PATH TO VCF>")

# Pandas DataFrame
df = vcf.read_vcf_as_pandas("<PATH TO VCF>", "chr1:10M-20M", info_fields=["AC", "AF"], sample_fields=["GT"], samples=["SRR123456", "SRR98765"])

# Polars DataFrame
df = vcf.read_vcf_as_polars("<PATH TO VCF>", ...)
```
